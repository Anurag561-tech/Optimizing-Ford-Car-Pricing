# Optimizing Ford Car Pricing: Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis with Generative AI

## Project Overview

This project involves building a predictive model for used car prices, specifically for Ford cars, using a dataset provided by a used car dealership. The primary goal is to predict the optimum quotation price based on various car features. The project involves several key steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model development, evaluation, and data augmentation.

## Project Scenario

You are a Data Scientist working for a consultancy firm that has been tasked with helping a used car dealer determine the optimal pricing for Ford cars. The dealer has provided historical sales data, and your task is to build a predictive model using this data. The dataset includes various features of the cars, such as model, year, transmission type, mileage, fuel type, tax, mpg, engine size, and price.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the Ford Car Pricing Dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset has been slightly modified for this project. Below is a description of the dataset's attributes:

| Variable     | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `model`      | Car model name                                   |
| `year`       | Year of car make                                 |
| `transmission` | Type of transmission (Automatic, Manual, Semi-Auto) |
| `mileage`    | Number of miles traveled                         |
| `fuelType`   | The type of fuel the car uses (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric, Other) |
| `tax`        | Annual Tax payable in USD                        |
| `mpg`        | Miles per Gallon that the car runs at            |
| `engineSize` | Engine Size of the car                           |
| `price`      | Price of car in USD                              |

## Project Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Identify and handle missing values.
    - Remove duplicate entries from the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Identify the number of sales for each fuel type.
    - Determine which transmission type has more price outliers.
    - Analyze the correlation between features and price.

3. **Data Augmentation**:
    - Augment the dataset with additional synthetic samples using Generative AI provided by [MOSTLY.AI](https://mostly.ai/).

4. **Model Development**:
    - Compare linear, polynomial, and ridge regression models to identify the best-performing model.
    - Use Grid Search to find the optimum hyperparameters for the Ridge regression model.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Fit and evaluate models using metrics such as RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).


## Usage

- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
- Perform EDA to gain insights into the data.
- Augment the data using synthetic samples generated by MOSTLY.AI.
- Develop and evaluate various regression models to predict car prices.
- Use Generative AI to automate code generation for these tasks.


This project was developed as part of a hands-on lab on using Generative AI for data science tasks. The dataset is provided by Kaggle and has been slightly modified for the purpose of this project. Data augmentation was performed using synthetic data generated by [MOSTLY.AI](https://mostly.ai/).
